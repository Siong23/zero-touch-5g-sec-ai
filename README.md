# zero-touch-5g-sec-ai

> **Intelligent, Zero-Touch Security and Management for 5G Networks using Deep Learning**

This project explores the use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including ..., to automate anomaly detection in 5G network traffic. It integrates AI models into a zero-touch network management workflow using Kubernetes.

---

## Key Features

- Deep learning–based anomaly detection on 5G traffic
- Dataset support: Simulated testbed traffic + public 5G-NIDD dataset
- Containerized and orchestratable via Kubernetes
- Monitoring and observability with Prometheus & Grafana
- Designed for Zero-Touch Operations (ZTO) in future mobile networks

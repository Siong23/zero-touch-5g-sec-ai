# Milestones
## 1. Build Deep Learning Model for Anomaly Detection
- Do a preprocessing and feature selections on 5G-NIDD public dataset.
- Design a Vanilla LSTM model.
- Train and test the model based on the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluate the metrics performance of the model.
Date to achieve: 15th August 2025

## 2. Integrate AI inference, mitigation, and monitoring
- Deploy the trained Vanilla LSTM model into a web system.
- Simulate attacks to check detection using the deployed Deep Learning model.
- Suggest mitigation (if any) to handle the attacks.
Date to achieve: 12th September 2025

## 3. Implement Zero-Touch Closed Loop
- Deploy each components of the architecture into their respective components.
- Link each container to create a closed loop.
- Run attacks simulations to test the closed-loop.
Date to achieve: 3rd October 2025
